Pyjoomatic
###########

Pyjoomatic is a embrionyc project that provide some automation for a joomla site
(only the administration part for now).

I wanted to do some automated import, ensuring consistency in a Joomla website.
I found the best way in my case (not the efficient) was to use automation through selenium.

Note I did'nt write a product for I'm not a PHP specialist,
and I found very difficult the API of Joomla
(there is a full stack of legacy, and many logic happens in views).
